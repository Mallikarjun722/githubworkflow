*Project Scope*  
For this sprint, our team is creating a private social media platform. It’s similar to Facebook but designed specifically for MIT students. We’re focusing on important features like login/signup, posting, liking, commenting, and chatting, while tailoring the experience for our campus community.  

In addition to the standard features, we want to add something interactive and fun. We plan to include a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that users can play with friends directly in the app.  

Here’s what we plan to complete by the end of this sprint:  

- A working login/signup system with user profiles  
- A post feed for users to share and interact with content  
- A basic real-time chat feature  
- A simple friend request system  
- An in-app multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game  

We’ve decided to leave out some features for now, such as stories, group chats, detailed notifications, and final deployment. Our main goal is to create a functional MVP that feels complete and works well, even if it’s simple.  

*Milestones and Timeline*  
We’ve organized our timeline around the key sessions during the sprint:  

Sprint Kickoff (Today): We refined the idea, defined our scope, divided responsibilities, and created a rough task breakdown.  

By the "Game structure with Copilot" session: We aim to finish the core game logic and have a basic two-player version of Tic-Tac-Toe ready.  

By the "Mid-sprint demo": We want the authentication system, profile setup, post feed, and chat features working. The game should also be ready for a live demo between two users.  

By the final review: Everything should be fully integrated, with a clean and user-friendly UI. We’ll also test the app, fix bugs, and prepare a short walkthrough for the demo.  

*Team Roles and Responsibilities*  
We’ve assigned roles based on everyone’s strengths and interests, but we’re staying flexible to support each other as needed.  

Teammate 1:  
I’m working on the frontend, focusing on the chat interface and the UI for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I’ll also integrate these parts into the main dashboard to ensure everything works smoothly.  

Teammate 2:  
They’re handling the backend, setting up Express.js, creating MongoDB models, and building the APIs for posts, messages, and the game.  

Teammate 3:  
They’re managing user authentication, which includes login, signup, and profile management. They’re also responsible for the friend request feature.  

Teammate 4:  
They’re supporting testing and polishing the UI. They’re also managing our GitHub workflows and helping us stay organized for the final demo.  

To stay connected, we’re using Discord for daily communication and GitHub Issues to track progress. We’ve also agreed to hold regular check-ins to ensure we’re all on the same page and moving forward together.  

*Anticipated Challenges and Strategies*  
We expect some challenges, especially with real-time features and managing our time.  

Potential challenges:  

- Ensuring chat and game updates sync properly between users  
- Avoiding too many features and keeping on track with our schedule  
- Managing merge conflicts on shared components  
- Keeping the UI consistent across different pages and components  

How we plan to handle them:  

- Start with basic, working versions of each feature and improve them later  
- Stick to a clear Git branching strategy and push changes frequently  
- Check in daily to catch blockers early and support one another  
- Use a shared design system and reuse components for consistency
